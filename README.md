## Foreward
These are my answers for Prime's FrontendMaster's course. It includes both the instructor's code and those not explicitly completed in the coursework. My work is completed using Class-based notation, but it should be easily convertible to Type-based notation (as is the case w/ the instructor's format). 

This is only due to familiarity, and I probably should've completed them using Types given that the course is based on Typescript. That said, it can be completed using other language and format structures as well. Regardless, the tests are ðŸŸ©.

I've also included diagrams for most, if not all, course sections in the following repo. They're created using Excalidraw, which you can view within VSCode using the Excalidraw extension.

These diagrams closely resemble Prime's. As ðŸ”¥ as they were originally, they could be a bit hard to read so I figured it'd be nice to clean them up. Good luck!

### If you have a suggestion
make an issue and we will come up with the potential name.

### WARNING
I have just started to add algorithms, so the number of supported algorithms is
limited at the moment, but will grow fairly quick.

### WARNING
OUT OF DATE.  We have quite a few more.  need to update
### Supported Algorithm
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* QuickSort
* Prim's MST (Adjacency List)
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path (Adjacency List)

### Supported Data Structures
* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Queue
* Stack
* Graph with Adjacency List
* Graph with Adjacency Matrix (untested)

### How It Works

Make you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and yarn installed: `npm install --global yarn`

clone the repo and install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

edit the `ligma.config.js` file
```javascript
module.exports = {
    dsa: [
        "InsertionSort",
        "MergeSort",
        "Queue",
        "Stack",
        "QuickSort",
        "DijkstraList",
        "PrimsList",
    ],
}
```

create a day of katas, this will use the list in the `ligma.config.js`.
```bash
yarn generate
```

this will progressively create folders named

```
src/day1
src/day2
...
```

`yarn generate` will also update the `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config` to point
the latest `day` folder via tspaths.  This allows us to avoid updating anything
for testing each day.

#### Testing
```
yarn test
```

I have yet to create a testing strategy for next sets of algorithms, but we
will get there when i cross that bridge.

### Help wanted
A simple way to specify test, thinking something like `tests.json` and `cat
test.json 2> /dev/null` to specify the tests to run.  tests.json wouldn't be
committed.
